## Milestone 4 

1. User Model: This defines how data is structured for users with names, emails, passwords, and how they go about their storage in the database.     
2. User Controller : Controls the operations like create, update, or retrieve the user details from the database.   
3. Multer Setup: File handling, for instance, for saving the user profile picture or other files.  


## Milestone 5
1. Sign-Up Page UI Created a Sign-Up Page with React with fields that include:       
Name        
Email     
Password         

2. Form Validation           
Used a validation object developed by applying Regular Expressions to test:            
Name: Must not be empty and characters.         
Email: Should meet proper email format, such as example@example.com.         
Password: Secured by checking for security such as minimum length

Configured React Router for easy navigation between pages          
Set up routing for the present page.   


## Milestone-6

1. JWT Token Generation: During signup, a JSON Web Token is generated for the user. The JWT token has the email of the user and is used for email verification.

2. Verification Link: A unique URL is generated by inserting the JWT token. This URL is sent to the email of the user.

3. This app is configured to send a verification email via Nodemailer. It contains the verification link with a JWT token.

4. Token Verification Endpoint
It creates an endpoint that checks the token whenever the user clicks the verification link. If it's valid, the user's account will be activated.


## Milestone -7 

Signup:

User will send their name, email and password.   
Checks if user exists in database:    
If User exists: returns a message to login.  
If User Does not exist: hashes the password through bcrypt and stores the user into database.

Login:

User will send his/her email and password. 
Checks if user exists in database:   
If The user is found: entered password is compared with the hased password  
And if valid, then, generates a JWT token and send it as a cookie.   
It gives error asking the user to sign-up in case of being invalid.    

Route: 
POST /signup-for user sign up hashing of password    
POST /login - For user login with password validation and token generation.
