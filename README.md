## Milestone-2


### Key Features and Steps Completed:

Organized the project into two different folders of frontend and backend.

* Frontend Setup:

1. Created a new React app using npm createvite@latest ecom_frontend to handle the front end.   
2. Configured Tailwind CSS

* Backend Setup:  

1. Ran npm init -y to initialize backend    
2. Installed Express to develop the backend server, Mongoose, and CORS using npm i express mongoose cors and nodemon.     
3. Created the Login page with input fields for email and password.            
4. Handled the input of the user by creating email and password state with the help of useState hook.         
5. Used Tailwind CSS for styling the Login page.


## Milestone -3

Organized files and folders for better readability and functionality

* Server Setup:    
1. Developed a backend server with Node.js and Express and handled Api requests      
2. Set up the server to listen  for a specific port for incoming requests
*  Database Connection      
1. Connected MongoDB to handle data storage.
2. Ensured a successful connection  between the server and database.

Added an error messages with better debugging.

## Milestone 4 

1. User Model: This defines how data is structured for users with names, emails, passwords, and how they go about their storage in the database.     
2. User Controller : Controls the operations like create, update, or retrieve the user details from the database.   
3. Multer Setup: File handling, for instance, for saving the user profile picture or other files.  


## Milestone 5
1. Sign-Up Page UI Created a Sign-Up Page with React with fields that include:       
Name        
Email     
Password         

2. Form Validation           
Used a validation object developed by applying Regular Expressions to test:            
Name: Must not be empty and characters.         
Email: Should meet proper email format, such as example@example.com.         
Password: Secured by checking for security such as minimum length          

3. React Router Configuration                  
Configured React Router for easy navigation between pages          
Set up routing for the present page.   


## Milestone-6

1. JWT Token Generation: During signup, a JSON Web Token is generated for the user. The JWT token has the email of the user and is used for email verification.

2. Verification Link: A unique URL is generated by inserting the JWT token. This URL is sent to the email of the user.

3. This app is configured to send a verification email via Nodemailer. It contains the verification link with a JWT token.

4. Token Verification Endpoint
It creates an endpoint that checks the token whenever the user clicks the verification link. If it's valid, the user's account will be activated.


## Milestone -7 

Signup:

User will send their name, email and password.   
Checks if user exists in database:    
If User exists: returns a message to login.  
If User Does not exist: hashes the password through bcrypt and stores the user into database.

Login:

User will send his/her email and password. 
Checks if user exists in database:   
If The user is found: entered password is compared with the hased password  
And if valid, then, generates a JWT token and send it as a cookie.   
It gives error asking the user to sign-up in case of being invalid.    

Route: 
POST /signup-for user sign up hashing of password    
POST /login - For user login with password validation and token generation.

## Milestone 8

## Milestone 31

In this milestone, we set up Redux to globally manage the user's email state in a React application. Here's a brief breakdown of what is done:

1. Redux Store Setup (src/Redux/Store.js)

* We use configureStore from @reduxjs/toolkit to create a Redux store.
* The store is configured with a userReducer to manage the email state.
* The store is exported for use across the app.

2. Action Creator (src/Redux/User/UserActions.js)

* We define setUserEmail, an action creator to update the user's email in the global state.
* Inside setUserEmail, we dispatch the setEmail action to modify the Redux state.

3. User Slice (src/Redux/User/UsersSlice.js)

* An initial state is created with email set as an empty string.
* We use createSlice to define the setEmail reducer function.
* The setEmail action and reducer are exported for use in the store and components.

4. Login Component (src/component/auth/Login.jsx)

* useDispatch from react-redux is used to dispatch the setUserEmail action after a successful login.
* The entered email is stored in the Redux store.

5. Main App Setup (src/main.jsx)

* The Provider component from react-redux is used to wrap the App component.
* The Redux store is passed as a prop to Provider, making the global state accessible throughout the app.
